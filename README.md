# 🧠 LANGGRAPH ARTICLE GENERATION

A Python project that leverages **LangGraph** — a graph-based orchestrator for AI agents — to generate structured articles using Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository demonstrates how to design, implement, and run an agentic workflow that creates high-quality articles based on input prompts or topics.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

**LangGraph** is a framework for building long-running, stateful agent workflows by modeling them as graphs of nodes and state transitions. It enables complex, multi-step reasoning processes with persistent context, making it well-suited for content generation workflows. 

This project provides a complete system to:

✔ Define a LangGraph workflow for article generation  
✔ Connect to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Claude)  
✔ Manage multi-step generation with planning and editing  
✔ Output structured, ready-to-publish text

### 📌 Prerequisites

Install Python 3.9 or higher, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pages/` | Frontend or example generation outputs (e.g., article templates or UI pages) |
| `password.py` | Utility to securely load credentials |
| `my_api_key.env` | Environment file storing API key for LLM services |
| `password.env` | Environment file for additional secrets |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python dependencies |
